# NBA Three Pointers and Why They're Not the Problem
## Analyzing Three-Point Trends Through the Lens of the NBA’s Viewership Concerns

Over the past 15+ seasons, three-point shooting has become a defining feature of NBA offense, with teams taking more threes than ever before. During the same time, however, television viewership has declined—prompting critics and fans alike to blame the league’s growing reliance on the three-point shot.

But does the data actually support that claim?

**This project challenges the narrative that “too many threes” are driving fans away from the game**. 

Using data visualizations and league-wide trends, we debunk the most common critiques of the modern NBA, including:

- The idea that all teams now play the same style and the game has become repetitive
- Claims that more threes mean more missed shots and less excitement
- The belief that mid-range and inside scoring have disappeared

The evidence shows that:
- Teams still vary widely in how much they rely on the three-point shot
- Players are making more shots overall — not just taking more
- The mid-range hasn’t vanished; inefficient long twos have simply been replaced

After dismantling the case against threes, the project pivots to more plausible contributors to declining NBA viewership, including:
- **Shifts in Media Consumption**: Fans are watching differently — through social media, streaming, and highlights — which may not be captured in traditional TV ratings
- **Game Flow & Fouling**: Frequent stoppages and long free throw sequences can hurt the entertainment value
- **Player Availability**: Injuries and load management, especially for star players, can reduce the appeal of regular-season games

#### Conclusion:
The decline in NBA viewership is a complex, multifaceted issue — and blaming the three-point shot is an oversimplified answer. This project makes the case for a more nuanced, data-driven conversation about the league’s evolution and its future.
